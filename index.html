    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Hi! I'm Haryish Elangumaran, from Puducherry, Tamilnadu, India, currently living in Chennai with my lower middle class nuclear family.

Though I haven't accomplished with any certifications during my academic days except I got experienced doing an internship in EmCog Solutions and experience in doing mini projects.

I was looking for an opportunity to have a practical exposure and to connect myself with an organization to demonstrate my level of interest in Software Technology with my level of knowledge and skills. That's how I utilized the placement opportunities held in the college I got graduated recently and through that I got placed in Cognizant Technology Solution.</p>
